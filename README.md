# stepper_control_module
Module made to mount to back of standard Nema17 Stepper Motor with a diametric magnetized on-axis magnet glued to the shaft, enabling closed-loop velocity and position control

Features:
  - DRV8842 DC Motor Driver IC with micro-stepping enabled
  - AS5600 12-bit on-axis magnetic rotary position sensor with analog output
  - INA180 Current Sense Amplifier with analog output
  - 5V Linear Dropout Regulator with 18V (MAX) input capabilities
  - XT60 Connector for easy powering from battery (Recommended 3s/4s for stepper voltage requirements)
  - 0805 Components for easy hand soldering
